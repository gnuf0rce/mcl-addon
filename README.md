# MCL Addon

`MCL Addon` 支持在 [Mirai Console](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai-console)
中访问几乎所有 [Mirai Console Loader](https://github.com/iTXTech/mirai-console-loader) 命令行指令。

但大部分更改需要使用 [Mirai Console Loader](https://github.com/iTXTech/mirai-console-loader)
重启 [Mirai Console](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai-console) 。

# 安装
